# Model Comparison using Fish Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores and compares two regression models—linear and polynomial—using the Fish dataset. The goal is to predict fish 'Height' based on the 'Width' attribute. The analysis involves building Bayesian models, sampling parameters using PyMC, and comparing the models using the ArviZ library.

## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pymc pandas arviz
   ```
3. Download the 'fish.csv' dataset.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and run each cell sequentially.

## File Descriptions
- **fish.csv:** The dataset containing fish 'Height' and 'Width' attributes.
- **model_comparison_fish.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook with code for building models and performing model comparison.

## Code Details
### Libraries
- `pymc`: Probabilistic programming library for Bayesian modeling.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `arviz`: Bayesian data analysis library for model comparison.

### Dataset
The 'fish.csv' dataset is loaded, with 'Width' as the independent variable and 'Height' as the dependent variable.

### Linear Model
A Bayesian linear regression model is created using PyMC, with parameter sampling and log-likelihood calculation.

### Polynomial Model
A Bayesian polynomial regression model is created using PyMC, with parameter sampling and log-likelihood calculation.

### Model Comparison
Models are compared using ArviZ's `az.compare()` function, providing a table of values including `elpd_loo`, `p_loo`, and `elpd_diff`.

### Analysis
The analysis includes examining predictive accuracy metrics (LOO-CV, ELPD, p_LOO) and model complexity metrics (ELPD difference, p_LOO).

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the choice between the models depends on the desired trade-off between predictive accuracy and model complexity. The readme provides a comprehensive guide to understand and run the analysis locally.

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the analysis for your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please create an issue in the repository. Happy modeling!
