# Model-Comparison-using-Fish-Dataset
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores and compares two regression models—linear and polynomial—using the Fish dataset. The goal is to predict fish 'Height' based on the 'Width' attribute. The analysis involves building Bayesian models, sampling parameters using PyMC, and comparing the models using the ArviZ library.
